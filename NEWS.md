# wooldridge 1.1.0

##Updates to vignette

I removed written descriptions of the example problems, putting more emphasis on viewing clean code. Short notes point to what function arguments are used or to various R packages. For descriptions of the examples and rational behind each problem, students should refer to their textbook as the content offered by Wooldridge is quite clear.

A bibliography section has been added, including package citations and their authors.

An Appendix has been added, pointing readers to a few excellent sources for computing Econometric models with R. These are "Econometrics in R" by Grant Farnsworth and "Using R for Introductory Econometrics" by Florian Hess.

##Updates to README.md 

Improved readability.
