Description: Economics students new to both Econometrics and R may find the 
    tasks of learning both a bit daunting. However, if your text is "Introductory 
    Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, then you are in 
    luck! The `wooldridge` data package aims to lighten the task by loading any 
    data set from the text with a single command. In addition, the package contains 
    documentation for each data set and all data has been efficiently compressed 
    resulting in a total size that is 62.73% of its original. A wooldridge-vignette 
    recreates examples from every chapter of the text, offering a relevant 
    introduction to R's statistical model syntax. Note: Data sets are from the 
    5th edition (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), which is compatible 
    with all other editions.
