Title: 105 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge
Version: 1.2.0
Author: Justin M. Shea     
Maintainer: Justin M. Shea <jshea@roosevelt.edu>
Description: Those new to econometrics and R may find themselves challenged by data 
    management tasks inherent to both. The wooldridge data package aims to lighten 
    the task by efficiently loading any data set from the text with a single command. 
    Collectively, all data sets have been compressed to 62.73% of their original
    size. Most sets have robust documentation including page numbers on which they 
    are used, original data sources, original year of publication, and notes which 
    chronicle their history while offering ideas for further exploration and research.
    To resurrect a data set, one can pass it's name to the `data()` function or just
    define it as the `data =` argument of the model function. The data will lazily load 
    and, provided the syntax is correct, model estimates shall spring forth from 
    the otherwise lifeless abyss of your R console! If the syntax is an issue, the 
    wooldridge-vignette displays solutions to examples from each chapter of the 
    text, providing a relevant introduction to econometric modeling with R. The 
    vignette contains an Appendix of excellent sources on using R for econometrics. Note: 
    Data sets are from the 5th edition (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), 
    and are compatible with all others.
