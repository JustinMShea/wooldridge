Title: 105 Data Sets from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge

Description: Economics students new to both econometrics and R may find the 
    simultaneous introduction to both challenging. In particular, the process of 
    loading and preparing data before building one's first model can present 
    challenges. The `wooldridge` data package aims to lighten the task by loading 
    any data set from the text into the current working environment with a single command. 
    The package contains documentation for each set and all data has been 
    compressed to 62.73% of its original size. Just install the package, load it, 
    and use the `data()` function to call the data set you need to work with.
    In addition, a wooldridge-vignette illustrates solutions to examples from 
    each chapter of the text, offering a relevant introduction to econometric 
    modelling with R. The vignette also includes an Appendix to helpful resources 
    about using R for econometrics. Note: Data sets are from the 5th edition 
    (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), and are compatible with others.
